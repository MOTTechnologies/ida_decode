== Description

{IDA Pro}[http://www.hex-rays.com/idapro/] is a good disassembler.  It works 
great for Windows Portable Executable files.  However, it does not seem to work 
very well for raw binary.  It read them but then it needs additional manual 
(or scripted instructions) on where to crease assembly code. This script helps 
you disassemble raw binary using IDA Pro.

Now, instead of using this script.  
Please try to use NDISASM[http://www.nasm.us/doc/nasmdoca.html].  It comes 
with NASM[http://www.nasm.us/].  It's sole purpose is to disassemble raw 
binaries files.

== Installation

Download script and use as described in the Usage section.

== Usage
=== Usage: Sample Input: test.bin
This is a sample of the kind of input this script works with.  
It is a raw binary file.  
Yes, this particular file is only 3 bytes long and represents the encoding of 
a single assembly instruction; MASM encoding for the instruction ADD EAX, 10.
 83 c0 0A
 
=== Usage: Executing
IDA Pro can be run using only the command line.  It is not great a great 
example of command line programs but it gets this job done.  Note that I 
include the path to where I have idaw.exe.
 "C:\Program Files\IDA\idaw.exe" -B -Sdecode.idc test.bin

=== Usage: Sample Output: test.asm
 This is the output assemble file.  
 Note that the name of this file was determined in the decode.idc script.
